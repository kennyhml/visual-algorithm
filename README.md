# visual-algorithm

A django web application to display and modify common algorithm data structures in your brower using javascript.

Furthermore, I also plan to make it possible to execute a code snippet on the created data and show it's 
runtime to visualize, for instance, the inorder traversal of a binary tree.

## Planning to include:
- [Binary Tree](https://github.com/kennyhml/visual-algorithm/blob/master/static/js/tree/binary_tree.js)
- Binary Search Tree
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Array
